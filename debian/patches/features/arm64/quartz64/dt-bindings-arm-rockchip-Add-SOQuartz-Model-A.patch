Subject: [3/4] dt-bindings: arm: rockchip: Add SOQuartz Model A
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/7441d8c437883581dddfb616a087b399338244f0

The SOQuartz Model A base board is a carrier board for the CM4
form factor, designed around the PINE64 SOQuartz CM4 SoM.

The board sports "Model A" dimensions like the Quartz64 Model A,
but is not to be confused with that.

As for I/O, it features USB 2 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, a PCIe 2
x1 slot, HDMI, a 40-pin GPIO header, CSI/DSI connectors, an eDP
flat-flex cable connector, a 12V DC barrel jack for power input
and power/reset buttons as well as a microSD card slot.
