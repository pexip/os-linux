Subject: [PATCH 59/64] seqlock: Do the lockdep annotation before locking in
 do_write_seqcount_begin_nested()
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/6.1/older/patches-6.1.54-rt15.tar.xz

It was brought up by Tetsuo that the following sequence
   write_seqlock_irqsave()
   printk_deferred_enter()

could lead to a deadlock if the lockdep annotation within
write_seqlock_irqsave() triggers. The problem is that the sequence
counter is incremented before the lockdep annotation is performed. The
lockdep splat would then attempt to invoke printk() but the reader side,
of the same seqcount, could have a tty_port::lock acquired waiting for
the sequence number to become even again.

The other lockdep annotations come before the actual locking because "we
want to see the locking error before it happens". There is no reason why
seqcount should be different here.

Do the lockdep annotation first then perform the locking operation (the
sequence increment).

Fixes: 1ca7d67cf5d5a ("seqcount: Add lockdep functionality to seqcount/seqlock structures")
